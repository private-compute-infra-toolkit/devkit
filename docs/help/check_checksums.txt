usage: check_checksums [OPTION]...

  This script is designed to verify the integrity of files by checking their
  SHA-256 checksums. It verifies files against a 'checksums.txt' file in the
  current directory. Each line in 'checksums.txt' must contain the expected
  SHA-256 checksum, followed by two spaces, and then the filename.
